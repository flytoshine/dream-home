# dream-home
The "Dream Home" project facilitates housing requests for economically disadvantaged individuals via three user modules: admin, contractor, and user. Users submit requests, admins verify and approve them, and contractors manage the construction and provide updates. This system enhances efficiency in managing and fulfilling housing needs.
